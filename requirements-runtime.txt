# requirements-runtime.txt
# Keep minimal: only packages required at runtime.
# boto3: optional, usually available in Lambda runtime â€” omit if you don't need special version.
# Add here only if your code imports it or you need a specific version.

# Example: if you need cryptography at runtime, uncomment:
# cryptography>=42.0.0

# Example if using parquet in Lambda:
# pyarrow>=10.0.0
